%% 01
%  Read the 'Test_model01.out' file and extract the frequency-wavenumber
%  information (dispersion curve) for the Rayleigh wave fundamental mode.
%  Save the extracted data to a two-column file (e.g., an Excel spreadsheet).
%  Plot the dispersion curve and save it in .fig format.





%% 02
%  Read the 'DT0083_ago19-sept20.xlsx' Excel spreadsheet and produce a 2D color plot
%  of the temperature as a function of time (on the x-axis) and depth (on the y-axis).
%  Add labels, a title and a colorbar. Set the colormap to 'jet'.
%  Do you observe a different temperature behaviour at the surface rather than 
%  at greater depths? What could be the reason? 
%  Save your plot in .fig format.
