%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%% 01
%  The maximum amplitude of a signal is 0.4 mV, while its minimum significant
%  oscillation has an amplitude of 0.001 mV. Which is the minimum required 
%  bit resolution for this signal? Which is the corresponding elementary 
%  amplitude interval (dA) in which the Full Scale (FS) is divided (suppose that FS = Amax)? 



%% 02
% Plot a continuous sinusoidal signal with A = 3, f = 3 Hz and Phi = 0. Set x axis between 0 s and 1 s.
% Add labels to both x and y axes.




%% 03
%  Sample the sinusoidal signal in exercise 02 with a sampling interval SI = 0.01 s.
%  Plot it over the previous one with a different appearance (use line and markers).
%  Verify the Nyquist-Shannon theorem.




%% 04
%  Sample the same sinusoidal signal in exercise 02 with SI = 0.25 s.
%  Plot it over the previous one with a different appearance (use line and markers).
%  Verify the Nyquist-Shannon theorem. Which frequency are you observing?



%% 05 
%  Play with the appearance of your plot interactively (add a title, add a legend, add a grid, etc.).
%  Save it both in .fig and .png formats.
