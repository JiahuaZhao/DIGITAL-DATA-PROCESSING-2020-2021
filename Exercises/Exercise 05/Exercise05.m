%% 01 
%  Create a continuous wave which is the sum of a sine wave with amplitude A1 = 5 and frequency f1 = 0.25 Hz and a cosine wave 
%  with amplitude A2 = 10 and frequency f2 = 0.6 Hz. Define it between 0 and 10 s.
%  Sample your wave with a sampling interval SI = 0.1 s. Plot both the continuous wave and the sampled wave on the same figure (use subplot).
%  Use the function "compute_spectra" provided to compute and plot the single-sided amplitude and phase spectra of the sampled wave.
%  Now extend the length of the wave to 100 s and sample it (SI = 0.1 s). Compute and plot the amplitude and phase spectra.
%  What do you observe in terms of both shape and position of the amplitude peaks in the frequency domain? Why?




%% 02 
%  Sample the 100 s periodic wave of the previous exercise with SI = 1 s. 
%  Plot the continuous signal and the new sampled signal on the same figure (use subplot).
%  Plot the single-sided amplitude and phase spectra.
%  What do you observe? How do you explain it?
