%% 01 
%  Write a function that computes the distance between two points of a plane whose coordinates are P1=(x1,y1) and P2=(x2,y2).
%  Load the COORD matrix in coordinates.mat, containing a list of UTM East (first column) and North (second column) 
%  coordinates for ten different sites (the elevation is assumed = 0 for all points).
%  Use your function to compute the distance between the 1st and 5th point and between the 3rd and 10th point. 




%% 02
%  Load the A matrix in matrix.mat. 
%  Write a script that asks the user a number of row (i) and a number of column (j) and returns a message with the content of A(i,j).
%  Use the "input" and "disp" functions. 




%% 03 
%  Create a 10-by-10 matrix filled with random values. Remove all odd columns.
